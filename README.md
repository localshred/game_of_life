# Conway's Game of Life

[Conway's Game of Life][wiki] isn't a game you play. The only input is the initial board
and then the mutations just run on their own following a basic set of rules.

This repo contains my playful stabs at making the Game of Life in various languages.

See each language's README for installation/run instructions and videos of runtime.
