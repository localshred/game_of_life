# Conway's Game of Life

## See it in action

Checkout the [video][] I posted showing a simple 435 generation run.

## Why?

Because it was fun to write and have a visual on how an algorithm works.

## Installation

No installation required, you just need ruby.

## Run the game!

Conway's Game of Life isn't technically a game you play. The only input is the initial board and then the mutations just run on their own.

Either simply run the game for your terminal width:

```shell
$ ruby game.rb
```

Or, run the game for a specified board size by providing an integer:

```shell
$ ruby game.rb 50
```

## Other

I may get around to having some template loader or something like the [game_of_life][] gem has, but probably not. This was just some good fun.
